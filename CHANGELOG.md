#### 1.9.4 (March 11, 2019)
* Added notice of version switch

#### 1.9.3 (January 15, 2019)
* Fix Object names for To/CC/BCC as pulled from API (#83) - Thank you to @IanSimpson for submitting this fix. When creating a Thread (or any descendant) the AbstractThread base class was expect "toList", "ccList" and "bccList" items in the objects as pulled from the API. In practice, the "list" is just a construct within the API wrapper, and the fields in the API are called "to", "cc" and "bcc" respectively.
* Upgrade phpunit and fix tests (#68) - PHPUnit has been upgraded to use v6

#### 1.9.2 (November 1, 2018)
* This version adds support for the [Conversations: Received Messages](https://developer.helpscout.com/help-desk-api/reports/conversations/received-messages/) endpoint in v1 of the Help Scout API

* Introduced support for new [Beacon](https://www.helpscout.net/live-chat/) Chat conversation thread types

#### 1.9.0 (January 2, 2018)
* Minor tweak to avoid any confusion when creating a new `Message` thread and the `PersonRef` has a `customer` type instead of `user`.
* Added method to retrieve all the tags (Thanks [@crodas](https://github.com/crodas) and [@Vardkin](https://github.com/Vardkin) for PRs [#61](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/pull/61) and [#57](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/pull/57) respectively)

#### 1.8.2 (March 15, 2017)
* Update `composer.json` to use a tagged version of `codeclimate/php-test-reporter` instead of `dev-master`.
* Fix issue where `Conversation` threads default to `null` so `getThreads()` always returned `null`. [PR #42](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/pull/42)
* Fix issue where `PUT` request responses were not decoded to an array similiar to `POST` and `DELETE`. [PR #49](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/pull/49)

* Updated the README and the `examples/CreateCustomer.php` with examples of catching a `HelpScout\ApiException` with errors.

#### 1.6.3 (June 29, 2015)
* Added an "expect" default header set to nothing. On some API calls, a dual HTTP status response was being returned. A fix was found [here](http://the-stickman.com/web-development/php-and-curl-disabling-100-continue-header/comment-page-1). By overriding the "expect" header, the server responds correctly.
This addresses the issue pointed out in [#22](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/issues/22)

#### 1.6.2 (June 23, 2015)
* Added support for the new Reports endpoints via Service Descriptions.

* Fixed a bug that caused an error when a response didn't have a location header to create a response ID from. If no location header is present, a null value is returned.
This addresses the issue pointed out in [#21](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/issues/21)

* Added dependency injector to allow mocking and testing
* Added tests and fixture data
* Fixed issue where `modifiedAt` was renamed to `userModifiedAt` in the API but not the client

#### 1.4.0 (April 2, 2015)
* Fixed issue that didn't allow "tag" as a valid search parameter - [#13](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/issues/13)
