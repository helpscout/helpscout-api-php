# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!  Use the [`looking-for-pull-requests` ](https://github.com/helpscout/helpscout-api-php/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alooking-for-pull-requests) label on issues to find items we're explicitly interested in seeing contributions for.  We're open to new ideas too, so don't be afraid to create an issue for an area you'd like to see this SDK improve.

## Removing/Changing existing objects/methods

If your contribution requires new or the removal of objects/methods please create an issue outlining the goals and changes to syntax.  This will help others (including us) get an idea of where you're headed and create an opportunity to get feedback prior to the pull request stage.
