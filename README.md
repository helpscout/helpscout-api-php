## Installation

The recommended way to install the client is by using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

The client is not coupled to any particular PHP HTTP client library, e.g. Guzzle. Instead it uses an abstraction called [HTTPlug](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/httplug/users.html).
This gives you the flexibility to choose which PSR-7 implementation and HTTP client to use. If you want to get started quickly you should run the following command:

```bash
composer require helpscout/api php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

This will install the API client and [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/index.html), which is our preferred HTTP adapter.

## Usage

You should always use Composer's autoloader in your application to autoload classes. All examples below assume you've already included this in your code:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Creating the client

Use the factory to create a client. Once created, you can set the various credentials to make requests.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\ApiClientFactory;

$client = ApiClientFactory::createClient();

// Set Auth token directly if you have it
$client->setAccessToken('abc123');

// Set Client credentials if using that grant type
$client->useClientCredentials($appId, $appSecret);

// Use legacy clientId and apiKey
$client->useLegacyToken($clientId, $apiKey);

// Use a refresh token to get a new access token
$client->useRefreshToken($appId, $appSecret, $refreshToken);
```

You can also pass auth credentials when you create the client.

```php
// client credentials grant
$config = [
    'auth' => [
        'type' => 'client_credentials',
        'appId' => 'asdf1234',
        'appSecret' => 'fdas4321'
    ]
];
$client = ApiClientFactory::createClient($config);

// Using Legacy credentials
$config = [
    'auth' => [
        'type' => 'legacy_credentials',
        'clientId' => 'asdf1234',
        'apiKey' => 'fdas4321'
    ]
];
$client = ApiClientFactory::createClient($config);

// Using a refresh token
$config = [
    'auth' => [
        'type' => 'refresh_token',
        'clientId' => 'asdf1234',
        'apiKey' => 'fdas4321',
        'refreshToken' => 'asdfasdf
    ]
];
$client = ApiClientFactory::createClient($config);
```

**Note**

All credential types will trigger a pre-flight request to get an access token (HTTP 'POST' request). To avoid this, set the access token on the client before making a request using the `setAccessToken` method on the client.
```php
$client = ApiClientFactory::createClient();
$client->setAccessToken('asdfasdf');
```
The access token will always be used if available, regardless of whether you have other credentials set or not.

### Customers

Get a customer.

```php
$customer = $client->getCustomer($customerId);
```

Get a customer with pre-loaded sub-entities.

A customer entity has a number of related sub-entities:

* Address
* Chats
* Emails
* Phone numbers
* Social profiles
* Websites

Each of these sub-entities can be pre-loaded when fetching a customer to remove the need for multiple method calls. The `CustomerRequest` class is used
to describe which sub-entities should be pre-loaded. For example:

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\CustomerRequest;

$request = (new CustomerRequest)
    ->withAddress()
    ->withEmails();

$customer = $client->customers()->get($customerId, $request);

$address = $customer->getAddress();
$emails = $customer->getEmails();
```

Get customers.

```php
$customers = $client->customers()->list();
```

Get customers with a filter.

As described in the API docs the [customer list can be filtered](http://developer.helpscout.net/help-desk-api-v2/customers/list) by a variety of fields. The `CustomerFields` class
provides a simple interface to set filter values. For example:

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\CustomerFilters;

$filter = new (CustomerFilters)
    ->withFirstName('Tom')
    ->withLastName('Graham');

$customers = $client->customers()->list($filter);
```

Get customers with pre-loaded sub-entities.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\CustomerRequest;

$request = (new CustomerRequest)
    ->withChats()
    ->withEmails();

$customers = $client->customers()->list($filter, $request);
```

Create a customer.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\Customer;

$customer = new Customer();
$customer->setFirstName('Bob');
// ...

$client->customers()->create($customer);
```

```

Update a customer address.

```php
// ...
$address->setCity('Boston');

$client->customerEntry()->updateAddress($customerId, $address);
```

Delete a customer address.

```php
$client->customerEntry()->deleteAddress($customerId);
```

#### Chat

Create a customer chat.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\Entry\Chat;

$chat = new Chat();
$chat->setValue('Hi, can you help me?');
$chat->setType('facebook');
// ...

$client->customerEntry()->createChat($customerId, $chat);
```

```php
// ...
$chat->setType('facebook');

$client->customerEntry()->updateChat($customerId, $chat);
```

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\Entry\Email;

$email = new Email();
$email->setValue('lucy@helpscout.com');
$email->setType('work');
// ...

$client->customerEntry()->createEmail($customerId, $email);
```

Update a customer email.

```php
// ...
$email->setType('home');

$client->customerEntry()->updateEmail($customerId, $email);
```

Delete a customer email.

```php
$client->customerEntry()->deleteEmail($customerId, $emailId);
```

#### Phone number

Create a customer phone.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\Entry\Phone;

$phone = new Phone();
$phone->setValue('123456789');

```php
$client->customerEntry()->deletePhone($customerId, $phoneId);
```

#### Social profile

Create a customer social profile.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Customers\Entry\SocialProfile;

$socialProfile = new SocialProfile();
$socialProfile->setValue('helpscout');
$socialProfile->setType('twitter');
// ...

$client->customerEntry()->createSocialProfile($customerId, $socialProfile);
```

$client->customerEntry()->updateWebsite($customerId, $website);
```

Delete a customer website.

```php
$client->customerEntry()->deleteWebsite($customerId, $websiteId);
```

### Mailboxes

Get a mailbox.

```php
$mailbox = $client->mailboxes()->get($mailboxId);
```

Get a mailbox with pre-loaded sub-entities.

A mailbox entity has two related sub-entities:

* Fields
* Folders

Each of these sub-entities can be pre-loaded when fetching a mailbox to remove the need for multiple method calls. The `MailboxRequest` class is used
to describe which sub-entities should be pre-loaded. For example:

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Mailboxes\MailboxRequest;

$request = (new MailboxRequest)
    ->withFields()
    ->withFolders();

$mailbox = $client->mailboxes()->get($mailboxId, $request);

$fields = $mailbox->getFields();
$folders = $mailbox->getFolders();
```

Get mailboxes.

```php
$mailboxes = $client->mailboxes()->list();
```

Get mailboxes with pre-loaded sub-entities.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Mailboxes\MailboxRequest;

$request = (new MailboxRequest)
    ->withFields()
    ->withFolders();

$mailboxes = $client->mailboxes()->list($request);
```

### Conversations

Get a conversation.

```php
$conversation = $client->conversations()->get($conversationId);
```

You can easily eager load additional information/relationships for a conversation.  For example:

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Conversations\ConversationRequest;

$request = (new ConversationRequest)
    ->withMailbox()
    ->withPrimaryCustomer()
    ->withCreatedByCustomer()
    ->withCreatedByUser()
    ->withClosedBy()
    ->withThreads()
    ->withAssignee();

$conversation = $client->conversations()->get($conversationId, $request);

$mailbox = $conversation->getMailbox();
$primaryCustomer = $conversation->getPrimaryCustomer();
```

Get conversations.

```php
$conversations = $client->conversations()->list();
```

Get conversations with pre-loaded sub-entities.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Conversations\ConversationRequest;

$request = (new ConversationRequest)
    ->withMailbox()
    ->withPrimaryCustomer()
    ->withCreatedByCustomer()
    ->withCreatedByUser()
    ->withClosedBy()
    ->withThreads()
    ->withAssignee();

$conversations = $client->conversations()->list(null, $request);
```
Get filtered conversations

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Conversations\ConversationFilters;

$filters = (new ConversationFilters())
    ->withMailbox(1)
    ->withFolder(13)
    ->withStatus('all')
    ->withTag('testing')
    ->withAssignedTo(1771)
    ->withModifiedSince(new DateTime('2017-05-06T09:04:23+05:00'))
    ->withNumber(42)
    ->withSortField('createdAt')
    ->withSortOrder('asc')
    ->withQuery('query')
    ->withCustomFieldById(123, 'blue');

$conversations = $client->conversations()->list($filters);

```

You can even combine the filters with the pre-loaded sub-entities in one request

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Conversations\ConversationRequest;
use HelpScout\Api\Conversations\ConversationFilters;

$request = (new ConversationRequest)
    ->withMailbox()
    ->withThreads();
    
$filters = (new ConversationFilters())
    ->withMailbox(1)
    ->withFolder(13)
    ->withCustomFieldById(123, 'blue');
    
$conversations = $client->conversations()->list($filters, $request);
```

Update the custom fields on a conversation:

```php
$customField = new CustomField();
$customField->setId(10524);
$customField->setValue(new DateTime('today'));
$client->conversations()->updateCustomFields($conversationId, [$customField]);
```

Delete a conversation:

```php
$client->conversations()->delete($conversationId);
```

Update an existing conversation:

```php
$client->conversations()->move($conversationId, 18);
$client->conversations()->updateSubject($conversationId, 'Need more help please');
$client->conversations()->updateCustomer($conversationId, 6854);
$client->conversations()->publishDraft($conversationId);
$client->conversations()->updateStatus($conversationId, 'closed');
$client->conversations()->assign($conversationId, 127);
$client->conversations()->unassign($conversationId);
```

```php
$users = $client->users()->list();
```

### Reports

When running reports using the SDK, refer to the [developer docs](https://developer.helpscout.com/mailbox-api/) for the exact endpoint, parameters, and response formats. While most of the endpoints in this SDK are little more than pass-through methods to call the API, there are a few conveniences.

First, for the `start`, `end`, `previousStart`, and `previousEnd` parameters, you may pass a formatted date-time string or any object implementing the `\DateTimeInterface` as the parameter. The client will automatically convert these objects to the proper format.

For those parameters that accept multiple values (`mailboxes`, `tags`, `types,` and `folders`), you may pass an array of values and let the client convert them to the proper format. You may also pass a single value (or a comma-separated list of values) if you like.

To run the report, use the `runReport` method available on the `ApiClient` instance. Pass the name of the report class you'd like to use as the first argument and the array of report parameters as the second argument. Be sure the keys in the parameter array match the URL params specified in the docs. The client will convert the JSON response returned by the API into an array.

```php
// Example of running the Company Overall Report
// https://developer.helpscout.com/mailbox-api/endpoints/reports/company/reports-company-overall/

use HelpScout\Api\Reports\Company;

$params = [
    // Date interval fields can be passed as an object implementing the \DateTimeInterface
    // or as a string in the 'Y-m-d\Th:m:s\Z' format. All times should be in UTC.
    'start' => new \DateTime('-7 days'),
    'end' => new \DateTimeImmutable(),
    'previousStart' => '2015-01-01T00:00:00Z',
    'previousEnd' => '2015-01-31T23:59:59Z',

    // Fields accepting multiple values can be passed as an array or a comma-separated string
    'mailboxes' => [123, 321],
    'tags' => '987,789',
    'types' => ['chat', 'email'],
    'folders' => [111, 222]
];

$report = $client->runReport(Company\Overall::class, $params);
```

### Webhooks

Get a webhook.

```php
$webhook = $client->webhooks()->get($webhookId);
```

List webhooks.

```php
$webhooks = $client->webhooks()->list();
```

Create a webhook.

The default state for a newly-created webhook is `enabled`.

```php
use HelpScout\Api\Webhooks\Webhook;

$data = [
    'url' => 'http://bad-url.com',
    'events' => ['convo.assigned', 'convo.moved'],
    'secret' => 'notARealSecret'
];
$webhook = new Webhook();
$webhook->hydrate($data);
// ...

$client->webhooks()->create($webhook);
```

Update a webhook

This operation replaces the entire webhook entity, so you must provide the secret again. Once updated, the webhook will be in the `enabled` state again.
```php
$webhook->setUrl('http://bad-url.com/really_really_bad');
$webhook->setSecret('mZ9XbGHodY');
$client->webhooks()->update($webhook);
```

Delete a webhook.

```php
$client->webhooks()->delete($webhookId);
```

### Workflows

Fetch a paginated list of all workflows.
```php
$workflows = $client->workflows()->list();
```

Run a manual workflow on a list of conversations.
```php
$convos = [
    123,
    321
];
$client->workflows()->runWorkflow($id, $convos);
```

Change a workflow status to either "active" or "inactive"
```php
$client->workflows()->updateStatus($id, 'active');
```

## Error handling

Any exception thrown by the client directly will implement `HelpScout\Api\Exception` and HTTP errors will result in `Http\Client\Exception\RequestException` being thrown.

## Pagination

When fetching a collection of entities the client will return an instance of `HelpScout\Api\Entity\Collection`. If the end point supports pagination then it will return an instance of `HelpScout\Api\Entity\PagedCollection`.

```php
/** @var PagedCollection $users */
$users = $client->users()->list();

// The current page number
$users->getPageNumber();

// The total number of pages
$users->getTotalPageCount();

// Load the next page
$nextUsers = $users->getNextPage();

// Load the previous page
$previousUsers = $users->getPreviousPage();

// Load the first page
$firstUsers = $users->getFirstPage();

// Load the last page
$lastUsers = $users->getLastPage();

// Load a specific page
$otherUsers = $users->getPage(12);
```

## Testing

The SDK comes with a handy `mock` method on the `ApiClient` class. To use this, pass in the name of the endpoint you want to mock. You'll get a `\Mockery\MockInterface` object back. Once you set the mock, any subsequent calls to that endpoint will return the mocked object.

```php
// From within the tests/ApiClientTest.php file...
public function testMockReturnsProperMock()
{
    $client = ApiClientFactory::createClient();
    $mockedWorkflows = $client->mock('workflows');

    $this->assertInstanceOf(WorkflowsEndpoint::class, $mockedWorkflows);
    $this->assertInstanceOf(MockInterface::class, $mockedWorkflows);

    $this->assertSame(
        $mockedWorkflows,
        $client->workflows()
    );
}
```

Once you've mocked an endpoint, you may want to clear it later on. To do this, you can use the `clearMock($endpoint)` method on the `ApiClient`.
